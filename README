This is the test suite for Shard-Query.

Currently, the test suite will test whatever default schema you have configured
for this installation of Shard-Query.  Thus the mapper tested will be the mapper
selected in the configuration, the options tested will be the options in the
configuration, etc.

Running the test suite
--------------------------------
run "php run_tests" to execute all the tests.  The results of the tests will
be compared with pre-generated result files that are shipped with the test
suite.  

Recording Results
--------------------------------
If you want to record your own result files (for example, if you change
the test cases) you will need to record new result files:
php run_tests --record

IMPORTANT: edit run_tests and change the host/username/password/db name in SQ_stub
if you want to record your own test results.  
The default credentials used are 127.0.0.1/root/toor/test
